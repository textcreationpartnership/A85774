            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Then was Jeſus led up of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, to be tempted of the divel,</hi> v. 1. <hi>and when he had faſted fourty daies, and fourty nights, he was afterwards an hungred,</hi> v. 2. and this we may properly call the <hi>preparation</hi> or <hi>introduction</hi> to the whole following <hi>narration,</hi> both touching the <hi>ſingle combat</hi> between <hi>Satan tempting,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour conquering.</hi> The whole then being thus <hi>divided</hi> in generall, into an <hi>Introduction,</hi> v. 1, 2. and a <hi>narration,</hi> in the nine following verſes, comprehending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>happy iſſue</hi> of all on our <hi>Saviours part,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>conqueſt;</hi> and the <hi>Angels miniſtring unto him,</hi> to <hi>congratulate</hi> his <hi>victory;</hi> we will examine the words in order, beginning <hi>verſ</hi> 1.

            <p>Secondly, That being for a time thus wholy <hi>ſecluded,</hi> and <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſociety</hi> of men, not <hi>known</hi> yet but to <hi>few,</hi> nor, what was <hi>done</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> at <hi>Jordan</hi> concerning him, not yet <hi>divulged</hi> to <hi>many,</hi> he might afterwards, with the greater <hi>Solemnity,</hi> enter on his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as one <hi>immediately ſent from God,</hi> and not <hi>choſen</hi> out of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgar,</hi> or <hi>ſent from men. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum praeclarum,</hi> the more <hi>rare</hi> any thing is, the more <hi>precious.</hi> The more <hi>rare</hi> an <hi>eminent Perſon</hi> is, and the <hi>leſs frequent</hi> with the <hi>Multitude,</hi> the more he will be <hi>reverenced</hi> and <hi>eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That, in the time of this his <hi>retirement,</hi> having no aboad at all in any <hi>Citie, full of people,</hi> and <hi>fuller of ſin:</hi> but, being far remote from all company of men, and from the <hi>noyſe,</hi> and <hi>tumults</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> of the <hi>unquiet world,</hi> he might, by <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>faſting,</hi> and other <hi>pious Acts of devotion,</hi> the better prepare himſelf for the work of God, <hi>his heavenly Father's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and, for his own, ſo much deſired, <hi>victory.</hi> Sometimes, <hi>to be alone,</hi> is a moſt excellent help <hi>not to be alone; Nunquam
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118868:11"/>minus ſolus quam cum ſolus,</hi> I am never <hi>leſs</hi> then when I am <hi>moſt</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>whole honour</hi> of his <hi>victory</hi> over <hi>Satan,</hi> might redound to himſelf alone, without any <hi>relation</hi> at all to any of the <hi>creatures.</hi> As afterwards, a little before his death, <hi>All his Diſciples forſook him, and</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 26.56.</note> 
               <hi>fled;</hi> and, in <hi>God's intention,</hi> for that end, <hi>they all forſook him and fled,</hi> that none might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>that man</hi> had any ſhare <hi>with his Son,</hi> in the <hi>Redemption of man;</hi> he <hi>trod the wine-preſs of his Father's wrath alone, and of all the people there was none with</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Iſa. 63.3.</note> 
               <hi>him;</hi> And therefore; all the glory and honour due to the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> was, in reſpect of any creature, wholy to be <hi>aſcribed</hi> to himſelf alone. So it is here: <hi>none aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> our Saviour in <hi>conquering Satan;</hi> and therefore none ought to partake with him in the honour of <hi>that Conqueſt,</hi> his alone the <hi>victory</hi> was; and, that the <hi>honour</hi> thereof might be wholy his alſo, he would be <hi>tempted in the wilderneſs.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>5ly, There alſo <hi>tempted</hi> he would be, rather then in any other place, even to manifeſt thereby, that there was <hi>no place fitter</hi> then that to <hi>Conquer</hi> the <hi>Divel</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Aquin. tert. pars Serm. q. 41.

            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Two</hi> Evangeliſts, Mark 1.13. <hi>and</hi> Luke 4.2. <hi>mention not the</hi> nights at all <hi>of our Saviour's</hi> faſting, <hi>but onely the</hi> forty daies; <hi>may we not then affirm that he was</hi> comfoted <hi>with ſome</hi> relief and ſuſtenance <hi>all thoſe</hi> nights?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; becauſe, by a <hi>Synecdoche membri,</hi> a part being put for the whole, they comprehend within that <hi>Accompt,</hi> even the <hi>nights</hi> alſo: our Saviour (no doubt) ſpending all that time of his <hi>faſting</hi> (knowing that the <hi>Divel</hi> was as <hi>buſie</hi> in the <hi>night</hi> as in the <hi>day</hi>) in <hi>beavenly meditations,</hi> in <hi>devout prayers</hi> and <hi>ſupplications</hi> to his Father, to ſtrengthen him when the time of his <hi>Tryal</hi> ſhould come, when the <hi>Tempter</hi> ſhould come; who (he well knew) was already in the Wilderneſs <hi>watching</hi> and <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> both his <hi>works</hi> and <hi>waies,</hi> as the <hi>Serpent</hi> was in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> before he <hi>tempted</hi> the woman <hi>obſerving</hi> firſt her <hi>geſture</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi> and which was the beſt way to <hi>aſſault</hi> her before he askt his <hi>Tempting Queſtion, Yea, hath God ſaid? Gen.</hi> 3.1.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>It appears by St. Luke</hi>'s words, <hi>ck.</hi> 4.2. <hi>that our Saviour was</hi> tempted <hi>of the Divel all thoſe forty daies which</hi> St. Matthew <hi>ſpeaketh of; or at leaſt that he was</hi> tempted <hi>long before the time of his</hi> faſting <hi>ended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is but an appearance; and there is <hi>light</hi> enough even in the <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. (rightly read) to diſpel the <hi>miſts,</hi> or the <hi>miſtakes</hi> rather of any that ſhall but imagine it; for, the <hi>Text, v.</hi> 2.3. ſetteth down plainly and in order. 1. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>faſting forty daies, and forty nights.</hi> 2. His <hi>hunger,</hi> after his ſo long faſting.3. His <hi>Tempting,</hi> after both; the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the other, and in the ſame order as they are there mentioned; as it is alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>In thoſe forty daies he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he aftewards hungred: and the Divel ſaid unto him;</hi> an <hi>Argument undeniable</hi> (becauſe the <hi>Texts</hi> poſitively affirm it) that our Saviour's <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118868:14"/>followed both his <hi>faſting</hi> and his <hi>hunger,</hi> and was not any waies a <hi>Concomitant</hi> or <hi>coaetaneous</hi> with the one, nor an <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> not a <hi>Concomitant</hi> with his <hi>faſting;</hi> for, the <hi>forty daies and forty nights</hi> were fully ended before he was an <hi>hungred;</hi> nor an <hi>Antecedent</hi> of his <hi>hunger;</hi> for, thereupon the Divel took the firſt <hi>occaſion</hi> of his <hi>Tempting:</hi> as after he had <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> ſo long a time, <hi>he was an hungred, v.</hi> 2. and after he was an hungred, <hi>then the Tempter came unto him, and ſaid, v.</hi> 3. then, and not before. So that when <hi>St. Mark</hi> ſaith, 1.13. <hi>that he was there (in the wilderneſs) forty daies tempted of the Divel:</hi> and <hi>St. Luke</hi> 4.2. <hi>being forty daies tempted of the Divel:</hi> they do not mean that our Saviour was <hi>tempted</hi> either all or any of thoſe daies wherein he <hi>faſted:</hi> no; and that the <hi>Comma</hi> in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi>

               <hi>Mark</hi> 1.13. between the time of his <hi>faſting,</hi> and the time of his <hi>tempting</hi> makes plain and manifeſt; and ſo ſhould our <hi>Tranſlation</hi> be <hi>pointed</hi> with the <hi>Comma,</hi> after <hi>forty daies:</hi> thus <hi>he was there in the wilderneſs forty daies, tempted of Satan.</hi> Thus alſo is that of <hi>St. Luke</hi> to be underſtood, as <hi>Interpreters</hi> rightly obſerve upon the <note n="n" place="margin">Ari.

            </p>
            <p>Lo! a Faſt it was, <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and <hi>miraculous;</hi> yet meer men I confeſs, have done the like, as <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 34.28.</note>

               <hi>Elias;</hi> though not by the ſtrength of meer men: no; neither did our Saviour; who after his <hi>long faſting</hi> was not at all changed in his <hi>natural conſtitution</hi> all that time, but was ſtilas ſtrong and <hi>vigorous</hi> as he was <hi>forty daies</hi> before, when he departed ſo ſpeedily from <hi>Jordan</hi> into the <hi>wilderneſs;</hi> ſo was <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> by the power of God: but our Saviour by his Father's, and by his own power; all <hi>faſted ſo long; Moſes</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 34.28</note> when he was ſent of God from the Mount to deliver the <hi>renewed Tables of the Law</hi> unto the people; <hi>Elias</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118868:15"/>was, that each of them, in their <hi>ſeveral times</hi> and <hi>ages of the world</hi> (as <hi>Moſes under the Law, Elias in the time of the Prophets,</hi> and <hi>our Saviour under the Goſpel</hi>) bringing their <hi>Meſſage immediately from Heaven,</hi> confirmed by their <hi>extraordinary faſting,</hi> might (as ſome <hi>extraordinary Perſons</hi>) be the more <hi>honoured</hi> among the people, <hi>and</hi> their <hi>Meſſage</hi> the <hi>more willingly received</hi> and <hi>obeyed;</hi> when they ſhould plainly perceive, that the <hi>God of Nature</hi> (as a means to procure more <hi>awful</hi> and <hi>reverent Authority,</hi> both unto themſelves and doctrine) had given them power ſo far to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the <hi>ordinary bounds of nature,</hi> as to faſt <hi>forty daies, and forty nights,</hi> without any <hi>intermiſſion;</hi> which was the <hi>full continuance</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>faſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Conſequence</hi> of his <hi>faſting</hi> was, that after he had abſtained from all manner of food ſo long a time, <hi>he was afterwards an hungred, v.</hi> 2. which we do not read at all either of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elias</hi> after their long <hi>faſting;</hi> we do not read it, becauſe no <hi>Pen-man</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> hath recorded it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there the ſame reaſon to mention their <hi>hunger</hi> (meer men) after their <hi>faſting,</hi> as there was particularly, our Saviours (God &amp; Man) after his <hi>faſting;</hi> and the reaſons why our Saviours <hi>hunger,</hi> in particular, is here mentioned may be two. 1. To mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all ſucceeding Ages, that he that was <hi>very God</hi> (the <hi>Perſon</hi> here to be <hi>tempted</hi>) was <hi>very man</hi> alſo: it being incident unto Man alſo, and not unto God to be <hi>hungry.</hi> 2. To note, that though the Divel, even then, were prepared to <hi>Tempt,</hi> yet the <hi>occaſion</hi> thereof (to a good end) was firſt <hi>offered</hi> unto him by our Saviour; and <hi>offered</hi> unto him by his <note n="q" place="margin">Permittitur eſurive corpus, ut Diabolo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi tribuatur occaſio, Hieron. in locum. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolog. de jejun. &amp; tent. Chriſti, Serm. 11.</note> 
               <hi>hunger, after he bad faſted forty daies and forty nights;</hi> neither doth this derogate from the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of our Saviour to give the firſt <hi>occaſion,</hi> and (as it were) <hi>provoke Satan</hi> to <hi>empty</hi> out the <hi>fowleſt dregs</hi> of all his <hi>malicious envity</hi> againſt him; but rather it doth <hi>magnifie</hi> it to all that ſhall rightly conſider, that when in ſeeming he was weakeſt, and at the <hi>loweſt ebbe,</hi> yet even then, he was able to <hi>Conquer Satan:</hi> to whom he therefore gave the <hi>occaſion</hi> of <hi>Tempting</hi> him by his <hi>hunger,</hi> that (knowing he would ſoon <hi>ſwallow the bait,</hi> and greedily accept the <hi>occaſion offered</hi>) he might the more <hi>victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Triumph</hi> over him, who thought himſelf ſecure enough, after he had gained ſo fit an <hi>opportunity</hi> to <hi>Tempt</hi> him, when he was an <hi>hungred.</hi>

            <p>We have now done with the <hi>Preparation</hi> to this <hi>combate</hi> on our Saviours part; who <hi>was led up of the Spirit into the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Divel; And when he had faſted forty daies and forty nights, he was afterwards an hungred, v.</hi> 1.2. In the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which comes next, and ſets before us the whole matter, we will conſider, 1. The <hi>ſeveral Conflicts</hi> between the <hi>Divel,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour.</hi> 2. The <hi>happy iſſue</hi> of all, on our Saviours part.

               <hi>world</hi> (as he is to them, <hi>ruling in the hearts of the children of diſobedience</hi>) and perceiving that he could <hi>imitate</hi> even the true God himſelf, in many of his <hi>works</hi> and <hi>waies,</hi> might the ſooner be deceived by him.

For inſtance: the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Divels inſtruments, turned rods into Serpents, and water into</hi>

               <hi>blood;</hi> in <hi>imitation</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, God's inſtruments,</hi> who had done the like to convince <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> if it had been poſſible, and make him underſtand himſelf: But the Divels end, by the work of theſe <hi>Magicians (imitating good men,</hi> though <hi>a bad way</hi>) was more and more to deceive and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118868:31"/>harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (too too much confiding in his <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had done ſuch <hi>miracles</hi>) and he attained his end there. He doth the like ſtill; and deſireth ſtill to attain the ſame end, even (by <hi>imitating the works of God,</hi> to the diſhonour of God) to harden the hearts of men and deceive them. And thus ſurely he dealt here; his <hi>work</hi> was <hi>wonderful,</hi> but his <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was <hi>deceitful:</hi> nothing at all for the honour of God, but rather to perſwade men, to <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore him</hi> for their God, who in this <hi>Caſe</hi> had power to doe as much to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as God himſelf had done once to <hi>Moſes;</hi> God ſent up the one <hi>into Mount Nebo</hi> to view all the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the Divel in <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof (to <hi>magnifie his power</hi> amongſt the ſons of men, too too much <hi>inclinable</hi> by his allurements, <hi>to magnifie him,</hi> and thereby deſtroy themſelves) <hi>taketh up</hi> the other <hi>into an exceeding high mountain,</hi> to ſhew him <hi>all the Kingdoms of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That by his preſence there, he might not only <hi>defile</hi> that place, but alſo as much as in him was, <hi>diſcountenance</hi> and <hi>diſgrace</hi> all thoſe <hi>memorable works,</hi> which oftentimes, even by the appointment of God himſelf, without his aſſiſtance, have been done ſince and before, on ſeveral other <hi>high mountains,</hi> though perhaps none of them on that <hi>mountain.</hi> As the <hi>Arke</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi> reſted on <hi>Mount</hi>

               <hi>Then ſaith Jeſus unto him, Get thee hence Satan.</hi> And then began our Saviour to be thus wrathfully <hi>incenſed,</hi> when his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's glory</hi> began firſt to be <hi>queſtioned;</hi> for 'twas not ſo when the Divel <hi>tempted</hi> him after his long <hi>faſting,</hi> to <hi>diſtruſt</hi> and <hi>diffidence</hi> in his Father's <hi>Providence, v.</hi> 3, 4. nor was it ſo when he <hi>tempted</hi> him to <hi>vain-glory,</hi> by caſting himſelf down from the <hi>pinacle of the Temple, v. 5, 6, 7.</hi> Satan received then, no rebuke at all from our Saviour; No; and the reaſon was, becauſe in thoſe <hi>Two Temptations,</hi> the injury was more properly, and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately done unto himſelf; and therefore he could without any indignation at all, patiently bear, and <hi>ſleight</hi> that; But when he ſaw that the Divel had <hi>appropriated</hi> unto himſelf, the <hi>honour</hi> that was <hi>peculiarly</hi> due unto God; <hi>All theſe things will I give thee: tempting</hi> him to become an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and ſo fall away from his God, from his Father; <hi>If thou wilt fall down &amp; worſhip me, v.</hi> 9. then his <hi>patient meekneſs</hi> was much moved, his wrath was very much kindled, and his fury <hi>exaſperated</hi> to the higheſt; to teach us, to bear with all patience and long ſuffering, our own wrongs and injuries; But to be more <hi>zealous</hi> alwaies in God's cauſe, then our own; as our Saviour here <note n="e" place="margin">Aquin. 3. pars Sum. q. 41.

            <p>Yet (though wrathfully and juſtly moved thereunto) our Saviour did not thus with indignation diſmiſs and ſend away Satan without <hi>a ſpecial Warrant</hi> from his Father's word to doe it; he did not; but as twice before, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 7.

Thy <hi>Ifs</hi> and thy <hi>Conditions,</hi> which are nothing elſe but the forerunners of thy <hi>Temptations,</hi> ſhall never take at all with me; and though thou wilt not alledge a <hi>Text</hi> rightly, when it makes for me, againſt thy ſelf, witneſs thy falſe dealing with me <hi>on the pinacle of the Temple;</hi> yet I do rightly alledge here what makes for my ſelf, and wholy againſt thee: <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> Him only; and I may not <hi>fall down</hi> before thee; this is my Father's <hi>Word,</hi> this is my Father's <hi>will,</hi> to keep his own Worſhip <hi>entire</hi> unto himſelf; and ſo will I keep it, and <hi>Worſhip him only.</hi> Thus and thus did our Saviour <hi>Anſwer</hi> Satan; partly <hi>rebuking</hi> his <hi>bold impudency,</hi> with <hi>Get thee hence:</hi> and partly <hi>denying</hi> his ſuit, with <hi>It is written;</hi> and this his <hi>denial</hi> (from which we may, we will, open our way to a further diſcourſe) briefly includes in it Two things. 1.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118868:39"/>
               <hi>confound</hi> him: but this It <hi>is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord; thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> was enough to <hi>conquer</hi> him and as before <hi>v.</hi> 4, 7. fully <hi>convinced,</hi> he had nothing more to ſay againſt the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> ſo now fully <hi>ſatisfied</hi> (no doubt) by this <hi>anſwer</hi> of our Saviour, that all <hi>religious worſhip</hi> was due to God <hi>only,</hi> and none at all to <hi>creatures</hi> (and therefore none at all to him) he dares ſay no more for any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>promoting</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> between himſelf and the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and that he was fully <hi>ſatisfied</hi> in this point, acknowledging that what our Saviour ſaid was true, we <hi>conclude</hi> from his own <hi>deep ſilence</hi> here, from his own <hi>not replying</hi> any more.</p>
            <p>Yet this is more then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will acknowledge, and willingly ſubſcribe unto; though they cannot but know, that our Saviour in the <hi>Text</hi> determineth the <hi>Queſtion</hi> poſitively againſt them; for he who to <hi>vindicate</hi> his Father's honour, ſaid to the Divel, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> ſurely never meant that any <hi>creature,</hi> how <hi>excellent</hi> ſoever, whether <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>men;</hi> whether <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Saints departed, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould any ways be ſharers with him in his own peculiar right of <hi>religious worſhip</hi> and <hi>adoration;</hi> never meant it, but the clean contrary; and ſo the <hi>Angel</hi> rightly underſtood it, <hi>though they will not;</hi> for when <hi>he ſaw John fall at his feet to worſhip him, he forbad him,</hi> ſaying, <hi>See thou do it not; I am thy fellow-ſervant, and of thy brethren, that have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus; worſhip</hi>
